# Record and Playback Sample Project

This is the project that we used when creating our course [Katalon Studio for Beginners: Create Automated Tests with Record & Playback](https://academy.katalon.com/courses/record-playback-testing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=prj) on Katalon Academy.

Record and Playback is one of the many quickest and easiest ways to create automated tests.

During the 3 chapters, you will learn how to use Record and Playback in Katalon Studio to:

* Create a new test case from scratch
* Reuse test objects from an existing test case to create new tests
* Record a test case from a specific AUT state on an active browser

In the first chapter, we will quickly walk through Katalon Studio – a free testing tool with Record and Playback. Then, you will learn how to use it for recording tests while performing manual actions on web pages.

In the second chapter, you will know how to reuse the previous test case to form a new one. To do this, you will add new recorded steps to the existing ones, which can also be the way to update any test case when the UI or workflow changes.

And in the final chapter, we show you how to do test recording right on your active browser where you’re working. This will help you save time and avoid duplication of test assets since you don’t need to record all the precondition steps to reach the current state of your UAT.
